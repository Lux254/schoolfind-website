        <h1>SCHOOL LISTING</h1>

        <h3 class="sub-heading">What is a School Listing?</h3>

        <p>A School Listing is your school’s official profile on our platform. 
            It serves as a digital space where you can present everything parents need to know—
            from programs offered and facilities available, to admission requirements and contact details. 
            Instead of relying on costly traditional advertisements, 
            your listing makes your school easily discoverable online by parents 
            who are actively searching.</p>
